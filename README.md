Genetic Algorith

This program uses a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing the 8 Queen Puzzle. 
Starting from an initial state of the puzzle where some queens may be attacking each other, 
the goal is to evolve such a state using GA to find a state in which no 2 queens are attacking each other.
